 GreenMove – Real-World Electric Vehicle Project (with IoT + Software Integration)
GreenMove is a hands-on project where we imagined, designed, and built working prototypes of four smart electric vehicles. This wasn’t just a concept — we created physical models, added IoT features, and even mapped out how a real production plant would operate.

 ->What We Did
Built 4 EV prototypes: UNO (urban sporty), DUO Y (youth-focused), DUO S (eco-conscious duo), and LIVRO (urban delivery van)

Combined hardware + software + IoT:

Realistic physical models with motors, suspension, storage, etc.

A centralized mobile app that acts as a digital key, safety monitor, and controller

Auto-switch features between DUO Y and DUO S with smart locking

-> Beyond the Garage
We didn’t stop at building. We:

Created a complete startup-style production plan

Chose a real site in Bulgaria with layout, supplier analysis, and cost breakdowns

Sourced components (batteries, motors, interiors) from real-world suppliers like LG Chem, Valeo, and Faurecia

Followed ISO standards for quality and safety

->Eco-Friendly by Design
100% electric, low-noise, low-emission vehicles

Smart logistics with rail-based shipping

Sustainable factory processes with waste management (RTI, MVR) and recyclable packaging

-> Why It Stands Out
This was more than a classroom project — it was a full simulation of launching a real EV company, from sketches to supply chains. We worked as a 10-member team across software, hardware, design, logistics, and financial planning.

If you want to see how we brought all this together, check out the slides or docs in the repo. And if you're curious about the prototypes — yes, they actually move.
